##Task Description

The restaurant landing page project was developed with the aim of creating a clean, colorful, and beginner-friendly website using only HTML and CSS. This project was designed to enhance my understanding of how to build a static landing page from the ground up, focusing on visual structure, sectioning, and user interface layout. The primary goal was to simulate a real-world restaurant website that showcases essential information such as branding, popular dishes, and customer engagement content, all while maintaining a pleasant and modern aesthetic.

The landing page begins with a header section that features the restaurant’s logo and a simple navigation bar. The navbar includes anchor links to all major sections of the page, such as Home, About, Menu, Testimonials, and Contact. The header was styled using CSS Flexbox to ensure proper alignment and spacing between the logo and navigation links, maintaining both symmetry and responsiveness across different screen sizes. The color scheme was chosen to be light and vibrant, reflecting a friendly and welcoming atmosphere suitable for a casual dining experience.

Next is the hero section, which serves as the visual focal point of the landing page. This section includes a bold headline, a short introductory paragraph, and a clear call-to-action button encouraging users to explore the menu or book a table. A high-quality background image or a clean vector illustration was used here to instantly capture attention. Typography was carefully selected using Google Fonts, ensuring both readability and elegance. CSS properties such as padding, line-height, and letter-spacing were adjusted to give the text a balanced and professional look.

The "About Us" section follows, providing a brief overview of the restaurant’s history, mission, and values. This section uses a two-column layout, combining text with an image that represents the restaurant’s interior or team. The content is arranged using CSS Grid to maintain a neat structure, and the layout adjusts responsively for smaller devices. A consistent card-like design with rounded corners and subtle shadows was used throughout the page to keep the UI cohesive.

The menu or “Popular Dishes” section showcases featured items in a grid format. Each dish is displayed in a styled card that includes an image, dish name, and short description. Hover effects were applied using transitions to give an interactive feel. This section plays a key role in highlighting what the restaurant offers and draws the user’s attention with colorful visuals and clear formatting.

The testimonials section includes customer feedback in a slider or grid format, styled with light backgrounds and italicized text to distinguish quotes. Profile icons and star ratings were added using placeholders to mimic real reviews. This section builds credibility and adds a human touch to the design. The final part of the landing page is the footer, which includes quick links, contact information, and social media icons. The footer was styled with a contrasting background color to visually separate it from the rest of the content.

Overall, this project gave me hands-on experience in building structured, visually engaging web pages using just HTML and CSS. It helped me understand layout techniques, improve my design sense, and apply responsive principles to deliver a well-rounded landing page suitable for a small business or restaurant.
